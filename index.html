    <p class="reg">  Hi, and welcome to my page.  I am currently a third grade dual teacher at Carman-Buckner.  This is my first year as a dual teacher and previously taught third grade mono. I've been teaching third grade now for six years.  Previously, I was a middle school math teacher and an elementary science teacher.  I have also taught firth grade. </p>

    <p id="myfam"> Also, I am a mom to three fabulous children.  My oldest, Sophia, is a freshman at Eastern Illinois University (Go Panthers!) studying to be a teacher.  I have two boys full time at home with me, both are in highschool.  Nathan is a junior, and Daniel is a freshman.  Needless to say, life is busy.  But isn't it for all of us!</p>

  <div class= "header">
    <h3>Here are 3 of my favorite websites:</h3>
  </div>
    
    <p class="reg"> I chose the first one because well..... with three children and a full time job, Amazon makes it easy to shop for many things needed or not right from home.  Secondly, I chose the Lake County Forest Preserves because I enjoy hiking and the forest preserves in Lake County just can't be beat!  And last, I chose the Chicken Chick because she has been a great resource for my backyard flock.</p>
